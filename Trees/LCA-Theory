a Vertex V that lies on the path from the root to v1 and the path from the root to v2,and the vertex should be the lowest.

LCA is the most bottoma ancestor of v1 and v2.
LCA lies on the shortest path from v1 to v2.
For all path related problems we use LCA.

The path from the first vertex to the second vertex will always go through its LCA.

Questions:
1. Given q queries,print the sum of nodes in the path from v1 to v2.(q<=1e5)
Solution:
depth: length of path from the root node
To find path from v1 to v2
sum(v1,v2)= sum till v1+sum till v2-2*sum till LCA+LCA

Methods to find LCA:
1. LCA using two pointers
2. LCA using Euler tour
3. LCA using Binary Lifting
