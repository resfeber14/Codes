//Problems on Euler Tour: 
1.
Ques: Print the subtree of a node x

Sol:
The nodes present between intime of a particular node x and outtime of x will give nodes in the subtree of x.
2.
Ques:Check if a node u is an ancestor of v or not?

Sol: 
It means v should lie in the subtree of u.And if v lies in the subtree of u.then,
 	Timein[u]<Timein[v] && Timeout[u]>Timeout[v]

3. //Since we have flattenned the tree into an array,Now if we want to do something to a subtree of a particular
//node, we can easily do in the range of the array.

Ques: Given a tree, Queries will be:Print sum of all nodes in a subtree of x

Sol: Preprocess the tree using euler tour and then we will know the tin and tout time of any node of the tree.
 We can precompute the sum using prefix Sum or Segment tree

4.
Ques: Given a tree, Queries will be:
Type 1:Print sum of all nodes in a subtree of x
Type 2: Increase all the nodes in the subtree of node x

Sol: Preprocess the tree using euler tour and then we will know the tin and tout time of any node of the tree.
then,Use segment Trees with Lazy Propagation.

5. 
Ques:In the subtree of node x,Output the minimum/maximum node.

Sol: Preprocess the tree using euler tour and then we will know the tin and tout time of any node of the tree.
then,Use segment Trees.
