Trees-> It is a connected graph which has no cycles.
-> Every pair of vertices have exactly one path between them.
Here, every pair of vertices has a path-> indicates It is connected.
Here, every pair of vertices have excatly one path between them-> indicates it doesn't contain any cycle.
If we have connected structure with (n-1) edges,then It is a tree.

Forest-> A collection of trees.Forest is a graph in which all its components are trees individually.


Questions:
Print the path from x to y
solution:
Make y as root node and print ancestors of it till x

Euler Path: A path that goes through every edge of a graph exactly once.
Euler Circuit: An Euler Path that begins and end at the same vertex.
Euler Path:
